# Deloitte-Innovation-Hub-Hackathon
Introduction
Welcome to the Deloitte x AUC Hackathon. As potential future consultants at Deloitte, you will face a reality that defines the consulting profession: clients come to us with problems, not solutions.

The Consultant's Challenge
Clients expect consultants to diagnose their challenges and architect innovative solutions. You will not receive a step-by-step guide, just like in the real world. Success requires both technical excellence and business acumen across four key dimensions:

Technical Skills: Can you build your solution?

Business Thinking: Should you build it? What value does it provide?

Team Work: Can you deliver it together?

Communication: Can you sell your solution?

How to Approach This Challenge
Each use case below presents a client with a real business problem. The business questions provided are meant to help guide your thinking and give you ideas on possible features to implement. Your approach should be:

Frame the business problem and understand the value proposition
Identify which business questions your solution will address
Design and implement technical features that deliver measurable business impact
Document how your solution creates value for the client (feel free to name your proposed product something creative)
Remember: clients look for measurable impact, scalability, and competitive advantages. Think like a consultant, build like an engineer.

**Fresh Flow Markets: Inventory Management
**The Challenge

Restaurant and grocery owners face a relentless balancing act. Over-stocking leads to waste and expired inventory eating away at profits. Under-stocking causes stockouts, lost revenue, and frustrated customers. The root cause? Poor demand forecasting. Without accurate predictions, businesses are trapped in a cycle of unnecessary costs, reduced profitability, and unsustainable operations. FreshFlow needs intelligent systems, not gut instinct.

Potential Business Questions

The following questions are provided to help guide your thinking and inspire potential features for your solution:

How do we accurately predict daily, weekly, and monthly demand?
What prep quantities should kitchens prepare to minimize waste?
How can we prioritize inventory based on expiration dates?
What promotions or bundles can move near-expired items profitably?
How do external factors (weather, holidays, weekends) impact sales?
